    <h1>An engineer, a mathematician, and a writer walk into a coffee shop.

        The engineer says, “I’ll have a black coffee, extra strong. I need to stay awake while I finish designing this bridge.”
        
        The mathematician says, “I’ll have a latte, but only if the milk is steamed to exactly 140°F. Precision is key.”
        
        The writer sighs and says, “I’ll have whatever keeps me from deleting my draft for the tenth time today.”
        
        The barista smirks and says, “So… three cups of existential crisis coming right up?”
